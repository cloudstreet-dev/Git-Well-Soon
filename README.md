## üíä A Note on the Medical Theme

Throughout this book, you'll encounter medical metaphors and Git puns. These aren't just for fun (though they are fun!) - they're memory devices to help concepts stick. When you think of a repository as a "patient file" or commits as "checkups," you're creating mental connections that make Git more approachable and memorable.
