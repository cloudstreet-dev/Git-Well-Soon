> "Please fill out these forms. Your insurance? Oh, it's free!"

## üè• Treatment Goals for This Chapter

By the end of this chapter, you'll:
- Have your own GitHub account
- Understand the GitHub interface
- Set up your profile (your "doctor's badge")
- Be ready to create your first repository

## üìã Welcome to GitHub General Hospital

GitHub is where your code will live, breathe, and get better. Think of it as a world-class medical facility for your projects - and the best part? Basic admission is completely free!

## üè• Step 1: Arriving at the Registration Desk

### Navigate to GitHub

1. Open your web browser (any modern browser works)
2. Go to: **https://github.com**
3. You'll see GitHub's homepage with a sign-up form

### What You'll See

The homepage will greet you with:
- A large "Sign up" button or form
- Some marketing text (ignore this for now)
- Examples of companies using GitHub (yes, even NASA!)

## üìù Step 2: Filling Out Your Registration Forms

### Required Information

Click "Sign up" and you'll need to provide:

1. **Username** (Your Hospital ID)
   - Choose wisely - this will be your identity!
   - Use something professional (remember: future employers will see this)
   - Good examples: `johnsmith`, `j-smith-dev`, `jsmith2024`
   - Avoid: `coolguy420`, `xxxcoderxxx`, `anonymous12345`
   
2. **Email Address** (Emergency Contact)
   - Use an email you check regularly
   - You'll need to verify this email
   - Pro tip: Use a professional email, not `partyanimal@email.com`

3. **Password** (Security Badge)
   - Must be 15+ characters OR 8+ with a number and lowercase letter
   - Make it strong but memorable
   - Consider using a password manager

### The Verification Puzzle

GitHub will present a puzzle to verify you're human (not a robot trying to commit code):
- Usually involves clicking on specific images
- Just follow the instructions
- If you fail, try again (we all fail sometimes, even with CAPTCHAs)

## üîê Step 3: Choosing Your Treatment Plan (Account Type)

GitHub will ask about your plan. For now:

- **Choose the FREE plan** (perfect for learning and most projects)
- You get unlimited public repositories
- You also get unlimited private repositories
- Free forever for individual use

### Free Plan Includes:
- ‚úÖ Unlimited public/private repositories
- ‚úÖ 2,000 automation minutes/month
- ‚úÖ 500MB of package storage
- ‚úÖ Community support
- ‚úÖ Everything you need to complete this book!

## üìß Step 4: Email Verification (Confirming Your Identity)

1. Check your email inbox
2. Look for an email from GitHub (check spam if needed)
3. Click the verification link
4. You'll be redirected back to GitHub

**Troubleshooting**:
- No email? Click "Resend verification email"
- Wrong email? You can change it in settings later
- Link expired? Request a new one

## üé® Step 5: Personalizing Your Profile (Your Doctor's Badge)

Once verified, let's set up your profile:

### The Welcome Survey

GitHub may ask questions like:
- What are you interested in?
- How much programming experience do you have?
- What do you want to do?

**Answer honestly or skip** - these just help GitHub customize your experience.

### Setting Up Your Profile

Navigate to your profile by clicking your avatar (top-right corner) ‚Üí "Your profile"

Add these essentials:

1. **Profile Picture**
   - Upload a professional photo OR
   - Keep the auto-generated avatar (it's unique to you!)
   - Avoid: memes, inappropriate images

2. **Bio** (Your Medical Specialty)
   - Short description of who you are
   - Example: "Learning to code | Aspiring developer | Git wellness student"
   - Keep it under 160 characters

3. **Display Name**
   - Your real name or professional alias
   - This appears alongside your username

4. **Location** (Optional)
   - Your city or country
   - Helps with networking and job opportunities

## üè• Step 6: Exploring Your New Hospital (GitHub Interface Tour)

## ü©∫ Doctor's Notes

**Important**: Your GitHub profile is part of your professional identity. Many employers look at GitHub profiles when hiring. Treat it like your coding resume!

**Pro Tip**: Follow some popular repositories to see how others use GitHub. Good ones to start with:
- `freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp`
- `microsoft/vscode`
- Your favorite open-source project

**Remember**: Everything you do publicly on GitHub is visible to everyone. Be professional in all interactions.

*Fun fact: GitHub's mascot is the Octocat - a cat with octopus tentacles. You'll see it everywhere. It's like the hospital's therapy animal!*
