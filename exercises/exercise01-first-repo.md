3. Initialize with a README
4. Make it public

### Part 2: Clone Locally

   ```
4. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-git-practice.git
   ```
5. Enter the repository:

   cd my-git-practice
   ```

### Part 3: Verify Setup

Run these commands and verify the output:

```bash

pwd
# Should show: .../Code/my-git-practice

# Check Git status
git status
# Should show: "On branch main" and "nothing to commit"

# Check remote connection
git remote -v
# Should show: origin URLs pointing to your GitHub repo

# List files
ls -la

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You've completed this exercise when:
- [ ] Repository exists on GitHub
- [ ] Repository is cloned locally
- [ ] `git status` works without errors
- [ ] You can see the .git folder
- [ ] Remote is properly connected

## üöë Troubleshooting

**"Repository not found"**
- Check the URL is correct
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub

**"fatal: not a git repository"**
- Make sure you're inside the cloned folder
- Use `cd my-git-practice`

**Can't see .git folder**
